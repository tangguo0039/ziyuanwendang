1. What's myBase
============================

myBase is a powerful yet easy-to-use information management software 
that allows entry of unstructured text, webpages, images, documents, 
emails and even arbitrary files without regard to length or format. 
All information is automatically compressed and stored in the tree 
structured outline form. Unlike traditional database programs, myBase 
accepts text input like a word processor, and provides better methods 
for capturing, editing, organizing, retrieving, searching and sharing 
information.

With myBase, you get a personal knowledge base tool, research database 
program, personal information organizer, notes manager, mind manager, 
documentation tool, book writing tool, presentation tool, ebook maker, 
to-do list, customer data management, genealogy software, notes taker, 
address book, photo album, diary keeper, URL organizer, file organizer, 
rich text editor, and much much more. All this in a footprint of less 
than 25MB and will make your life easier.

myBase Desktop is now available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

2. System Requirements
=======================

To run myBase Desktop Ver 7.x, you will need a PC (or Tablet PC) 
running GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or Windows XP+.



3. Installation
==============================================

For GNU/Linux, simply extract the downloaded .tar package into your 
home directory or /usr/local, then you can double click on the file
myBase.run within X11 file manager or simply run the command line
'myBase.run &' in Terminal; You might also want to create a launcher
for myBase.run on the X11 desktop for convenience of double-clicking
to launch the program.

For Mac OS X, open the downloaded .dmg package file, then drag the
myBase icon and drop into the system Application folder, whereby
you can double click on the icon to start it.

For Windows, just run the setup program and follow the instructions;
You'll need to select the target directory and program group name;
Then you can double click on the program's icon to start it.



4. Uninstallation
============================

For GNU/Linux, simply remove the directory in which the program's .tar 
package was extracted.

For Mac OS X, delete the myBase icon from the Application folder.

For Windows, open Control Panel, double click "Add/Remove Programs" icon,
click "myBase Desktop", then click "Add/Remove", and "Yes" to remove it.

Note that you may need to create backup for your own .nyf database files 
created within myBase before uninstalling or removing the program.



5. Upgrade existing .nyf databases to Ver 7.x
==============================================

From version 7.0 on, myBase has switched over to save text content in HTML 
for better cross-platform support, with no support for RTF formats any more.
If you have existing .nyf databases generated with previous version 5.x/6.x
of myBase for Windows, and would like to upgrade to v7.x, please try to 
upgrade the database file format, by selecting the menu item
"File - Maintenance - Replicate from RTF to HTML ..." within myBase v6.3.8+
for Windows. The generated .nyf databases will work smoothly with myBase 
v7.x on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Note that unlike the RTF text format, the HTML text format doesn't support 
OLE objects embedding into the text content; If any RTF content containing 
OLE objects, they will be converted into thumbnail images in the resulting 
HTML contents, with no support of double-clicking on OLE objects to view
or edit them any more.
