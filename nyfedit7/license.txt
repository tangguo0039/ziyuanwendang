End User License Agreement (EULA)
__________________________________________________________


This agreement explains when and how you may use both trial and purchased 
copies of software products from WJJ SOFTWARE. In this agreement:

"Program" means the WJJ SOFTWARE product(s) you have purchased or obtained 
for evaluation, including both the software and the associated documentation 
and other materials;

"Trial Copy" means a copy of the Program distributed by us or by our 
authorized agents for evaluation purposes and which is described as a trial, 
shareware, or unregistered copy in the Program's sign-on messages or About box;

"Purchased Copy" means a copy of the Program purchased from us or from a 
dealer, and which is not described as a trial, shareware, or unregistered 
copy in the Program's sign-on messages or About box;

"Key" refers to the unique registration code that you receive when you 
purchase the Program;

"we" or "us" means WJJ SOFTWARE;

"you" means the end user of the Program.

This is a legal agreement which allows you, the end user, to use the Program 
under certain terms and conditions. If you cannot agree to abide by what this 
agreement says you should not use or evaluate the Program.

You may use a Trial Copy of the Program for evaluation only, in order to 
determine whether the Program meets your needs before purchasing it. While 
you are evaluating the Program, you may use it on as many computers as are 
required to perform your evaluation.

Once you purchase the Program, your use is subject to the following 
restrictions:

You agree not to install or use any individual Key on more than one computer 
at a time. However, you may install an individual Key simultaneously on one 
computer at work, one computer at home, and one portable computer, IF (and 
ONLY if) all these computers are used primarily by the same individual, and 
there is no possibility that the computers will be in use at the same time 
except while you are actively transferring files between them. This provision 
is only for individual Keys and does not apply to multi-user Keys.

If you purchased a multi-user Key for the Program, you agree not to install 
or use the Program on more computers than the number included in your license, 
as shown on your order, payment, invoice, or other similar documentation; the 
Program sign-on screen or About box; or other electronic or printed documents 
received from us or our dealer.

After your purchase, you may continue to use the Trial Copy on as many 
computers as you wish. You may NOT install your Key on more than one computer, 
except as outlined above.

You may freely distribute copies of the original (Trial) version of the Program, 
in its original format, so long as you do not charge more than a nominal fee 
to cover the cost of materials. You may not in any way change the original 
distribution file, except to package it within another archive if necessary.

When you purchase the Program, you will receive a unique registration code, or 
Key. You may not publish or distribute this Key by any means without direct 
authorization from us. If you do, your license to use the Program is 
automatically terminated, you must remove the Program from your computer(s), 
and you may be liable for legal damages.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE 
SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

WJJ SOFTWARE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING LOSS OF 
INFORMATION, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR ANY DAMAGE OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCURRED BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE 
USE OF OUR PRODUCTS.
