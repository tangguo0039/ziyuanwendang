End User License Agreement (EULA)
-----------------------------------------------------------


This agreement explains when and how you may use both trial and purchased copies of software products from WJJ SOFTWARE. In this agreement:

"Program" means the WJJ SOFTWARE product(s) you have purchased or obtained for evaluation, including both the software and the associated documentation and other materials;

"Trial Copy" means a copy of the Program distributed by us or by our authorized agents for evaluation purposes and which is described as a trial, shareware, or unregistered copy in the Program's sign-on messages or About box;

"Purchased Copy" means a copy of the Program purchased from us or from a dealer, and which is not described as a trial, shareware, or unregistered copy in the Program's sign-on messages or About box;

"Key" refers to the unique registration code that you receive when you purchase the Program;

"we" or "us" means WJJ SOFTWARE;
"you" means the end user of the Program.

This is a legal agreement which allows you, the end user, to use the Program under certain terms and conditions. If you cannot agree to abide by what this agreement says you should not use or evaluate the Program.

You may use a Trial Copy of the Program for evaluation only, in order to determine whether the Program meets your needs before purchasing it. While you are evaluating the Program, you may use it on as many computers as are required to perform your evaluation.

Once you purchase the Program, your use is subject to the following restrictions:

You agree not to install or use any individual Key on more than one computer at a time. However, you may install an individual Key simultaneously on one computer at work, one computer at home, and one portable computer, IF (and ONLY if) all these computers are used primarily by the same individual, and there is no possibility that the computers will be in use at the same time except while you are actively transferring files between them. This provision is only for individual Keys and does not apply to multi-user Keys.

If you purchased a multi-user Key for the Program, you agree not to install or use the Program on more computers than the number included in your license, as shown on your order, payment, invoice, or other similar documentation; the Program sign-on screen or About box; or other electronic or printed documents received from us or our dealer.

After your purchase, you may continue to use the Trial Copy on as many computers as you wish. You may NOT install your Key on more than one computer, except as outlined above.

You may freely distribute copies of the original (Trial) version of the Program, in its original format, so long as you do not charge more than a nominal fee to cover the cost of materials. You may not in any way change the original distribution file, except to package it within another archive if necessary.

When you purchase the Program, you will receive a unique registration code, or Key. You may not publish or distribute this Key by any means without direct authorization from us. If you do, your license to use the Program is automatically terminated, you must remove the Program from your computer(s), and you may be liable for legal damages.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

WJJ SOFTWARE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING LOSS OF INFORMATION, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, PERSONAL INJURY AND/OR ANY DAMAGE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCURRED BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS.
