1. What's Mybase

Mybase is a powerful yet easy-to-use information management software that allows entry of unstructured text, webpages, images, documents, emails and even arbitrary files without regard to length or format. All information is automatically compressed and stored in the tree structured outline form. Unlike traditional database programs, Mybase accepts text input like a word processor, and provides better methods for capturing, editing, organizing, retrieving, searching and sharing information.

With Mybase, you get a personal knowledge base tool, research database program, personal information organizer, notes manager, mind manager, documentation tool, book writing tool, presentation tool, ebook maker, to-do list, customer data management, notes taker, address book, photo album, diary keeper, URL organizer, file organizer, rich text editor, and much much more, that will make your life easier.

Mybase Desktop 8 is now available for Linux/macOS/Windows.

Note that you will need to create backup for your own .nyf database files created with Mybase before uninstalling or removing the program's folder.


5. Upgrading existing .nyf databases

If you have existing databases created with in 7.x, no conversion is needed. The version 8.x is back-compatible with v7.x.

If you have existing .nyf databases created with in previous version 4/5/6.x of Mybase for Windows, and would like to upgrade to 7.x/8.x, you'll need first to have Mybase 6.5.1+ for Windows installed and then select the "File - Maintenance - Replicate from RTF to HTML ..." menu item, which is able to convert/upgrade the database storage format. The generated .nyf databases will work smoothly with Mybase 7/8.x on Linux, macOS and Windows.

Note that from version 7.0 on, Mybase has switched over to the HTML format to save web contents for cross-platform support, with no longer support for the legacy RTF format.

Unlike the RTF text format, the HTML text format doesn't support OLE objects embedding into text contents; If any RTF content contains OLE objects, that will be converted into thumbnail images in the resulting HTML documents, with no support of double-clicking on OLE objects to view/edit.
