# Contributing to trident

trident is an open-source project.

It is the work of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Here are instructions to get you started. They are not perfect, so
please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

## Contribution guidelines

First of all, trident follows GitFlow, the branches description in the trident project are listed as follow:

``master`` branch:
This branch contains the latest code released to the production environment. It can only be merged, and can not be modified directly in this branch.

``develop`` branch:
This branch is the main development branch. It contains the complete code that is going to release. It can only be merged, and can not be modified directly in this branch.

### Pull requests

If you'd like to contribute to trident, you should follow the steps below:

- **Fork** a repository from **tronprotocol/trident** allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project
- **Fix** some code and **Commit** your modified code.
- **Send** a Pull Request（PR）for the maintainers to review and merge into the main codebase.
  *notice*：When you create a new PR，please choose the **tronprotocol/trident** as the base repository and choose **your fork/trident** as the head repository.
  And you must choose **develop** as the base repository branch, which means we will merge the PR into our **develop** branch when reviewed and approved.
  Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, please ensure you add appropriate test cases under ``/src/test``.

After the PR is checked by our Sonar check procedure and Travis CI continuous-integration check procedure automatically,
we maintainers will review the code changed and give some advice for modifying if necessary. Once approved,
we will close the PR and merge it into the protocol/trident's develop branch.

We are always happy to receive pull requests and do our best to
review them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull
request? Do it! We would appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be
discouraged as it can be a possible oversight. Please explain your code as
detailed as possible to make it easier for us to understand.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:

- Code must be documented adhering to the [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Code must pass Sonar detection.
- Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the develop branch.
- Commit messages should be started with a verb, and the first letter should be lowercase. The length of a commit message
must be limited to 50 words.

### Create issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as [a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/tronprotocol/trident/issues) before anyone
starts working on it.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

### Please check existing issues and docs first!

Please take a moment to check that your bug report or improvement proposal
doesn't already exist. If it does, please add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too".
This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
